# Generations
A program for performing generation in width, in depth, by beam and parallel.

Enter the initial value, the target value, and the number of tests.
Using permutations of the initial value, the target value is searched for.
The number of iterations for which the target value was found is fixed.
Next, they are used to calculate the mathematical expectation and standard deviation for each type of generation.
